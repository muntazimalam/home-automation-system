# üè† Home Automation System using NodeMCU and Arduino Cloud

This project demonstrates a cost-effective and scalable **Home Automation System** that allows users to remotely control and monitor electrical appliances via the **Arduino IoT Cloud**, using **NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32)** and **relay modules**. The system is designed for real-time performance, intuitive user interaction, energy efficiency, and layered security.

## üìå Features

* Control appliances remotely via web or mobile app
* Real-time appliance status updates
* Schedule-based automation and rule configuration
* Manual override using physical switches
* Encrypted communication between components
* Expandable system (add sensors, more relays, or voice assistants)

## üß∞ Components Used

| Component                | Quantity  | Description                                |

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

1. **User Interface (Web/Mobile)**: Controls appliances, views statuses, sets schedules.
2. **Arduino Cloud**: Handles communication, user commands, automation rules, and syncs devices.
3. **NodeMCU**: Interprets cloud commands and toggles relays accordingly. Sends feedback to the cloud.
4. **Relay Module**: Controls the ON/OFF state of connected appliances.
5. **Appliances**: Operated remotely or locally with manual override.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**

   * Connect relay IN pins to digital pins on NodeMCU.
   * Connect VCC and GND of relay module to NodeMCU.
   * Connect appliances to relay NO (Normally Open) contacts and COM.
   * Optional: Add manual switches to allow local control.

2. **Cloud Setup (Arduino IoT Cloud)**

   * Create an account at [Arduino Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/).
   * Set up a new "Thing" and link your device.
   * Define cloud variables for each relay (e.g., `light1`, `fan1`).
   * Auto-generate and upload the sketch to NodeMCU.

3. **Testing**

   * Open the dashboard on Arduino Cloud.
   * Use switches or sliders to control appliances.
   * Test real-time feedback and scheduling options.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

* All data transmitted via Arduino Cloud is encrypted.
* Only authenticated devices can access or control connected appliances.
* Local control available even during internet outages.

## üå± Future Enhancements

* Voice control integration (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant)
* Motion or temperature-based automation
* Mobile app customization
* Energy usage analytics
